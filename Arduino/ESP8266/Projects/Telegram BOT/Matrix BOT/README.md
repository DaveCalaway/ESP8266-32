This code receive a massage from a Telegram Bot and respond of a specific requests.
One of this command can **display** ( /disp ) a msg on the Matrix display.

### RFID Tag:
I added an [RFID Tag](https://goo.gl/22V3ci) inside the case with the link to a chat with the BOT.   
Write in the Tag this [link](https://goo.gl/U5snzo):   
`https://telegram.me/<bot username>?start   `
